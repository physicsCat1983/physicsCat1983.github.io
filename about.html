				<h2>About</h2>
				
				<p id="about">
					Brainy Hand Creations makes items for your home decor and more! Each item is personally hand crafted by our creator, Dustin Hodges, who personally cuts, sands, paints and finishes every single piece.
					Every wooden made item is made from reclaimed wood that has been meticulously inspected and salvaged from pallets, fencing, old construction and the like. Each piece is personal and crafted with care.
				</p>
				
				<p id="about">
					Brainy Hand Creations is a one man show, created by Dustin Hodges, started from an idea to get back to basics of crafting for pleasure, self-fulfilment and for monetary reasons, since people loved the
					work so much. The type of work done by BHC make for wonderful pieces to place about a home, whether it be indoors or outdoors, because each piece is generously coated with a protective finish that
					stands up to the elements for a longer period of time. 
				</p>
				
				<p id="about">
					BHC is proud of the work that it offers to the individuals who desire unique pieces that cannot be found in big-box stores and more importantly, items
					that are individually made by hand in the USA. So, have a look around the <a href="gallery.html"><b>Gallery</b></a> and take a gander at what has been done, make a stop by our 
					<a href="index.html"><b>Home</b></a> page to see some of our fantastic customers, take a look at some of our <a href="gallery.html#flags"><b>popular</b></a> items, and don't forget to see our 
					holiday items and home pieces in the <a href="gallery.html#holidays"><b>Holidays</b></a> and <a href="gallery.html#signs"><b>Signs 'n More</b></a> sections.
